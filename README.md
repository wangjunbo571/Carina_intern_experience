This is a personal portfolio site to introduce myself. 
The main page contains three parts, including header, cards and contact area.
    In the header, I designed four navigation links to lead users to each specific cards. It allows users to find desired information without scrolling down the whole page.
    I designed four cards to introduce myself from Education background, Intern Experience, Extracurricular activities and projects.
    After looking through my page, users can contact with me through the icons on the bottom of page. I provided three contacting ways.
At the same time, I built a sub-page to show the details about each aspects. I did not build four sub-page for each aspect, because they share similar outlooking. I took the Projects for example. The examples of projects are based on other websites.
